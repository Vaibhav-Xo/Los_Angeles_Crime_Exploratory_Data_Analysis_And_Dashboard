## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Los Angeles crime data. By leveraging advanced data visualization techniques and statistical analysis, I aim to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help public safety strategies.

## About Dataset
The dataset consist of 499 rows and 13 columns which include likes of DR_NO[Data Record Number], Date_Rptd, Date_Occ, Area_Name, Crm_Cd(Crime Code), Crm_Cd_Desc(Crime Code Description), Vict_Age, Vict_Sex, Premis_Desc(Premise Description), Status, Loaction, LAT, LAN.  

## Tools And Libraries Used
* Google Colab
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib 
* Seaborn 
* Plotly
* Folium
* Power Bi

## Steps Performed 
### 1] Dataset Exploration 
* Loading CSV 
* Checking Shape of Dataset
* Checking Column Datatypes
* Checking Null Values
* Identifying Outliers

### 2] Data Preprocessing
* Filling Null Values
* Creating New Columns [Month_Rptd,Year_Rptd,Month_Occ,Year_Occ]
* Checking Unique values in Columns
* Creating new categories for analysis purpose by clubbing existing values in column 
* Deleting irrelevent columns for analysis

### 3] Data visualization
### Univariate Analysis 
* Drawing insights by checking distribution for each column at a time using charts like: [Countplot, Histogram, Piechart]

#### Bivariate Analysis
* Drawing insights by checking trends and relation between two columns simultaneously using charts like: [Boxplot, Heatmaps, Scatterplot, LinePlot]

#### Spatial Analysis
* Plotting Map to visualize hotspots of crime.

## Insights Drawn From Analysis
* 1] Crime Hostpots of LA
* 2] Top Occuring Crimes in LA
* 3] Distribution of Victim based on their age 
* 4] Count of crime based on Victim gender
